The idea behind this is to create a video database on my Seagate GoFlex Home,
and thus it became a project to make a very light weight site that could run on there,
but also use some fun frameworks/languages.


Languages:
  Javascript (jQuery)
  CSS (LESS)
  PHP


GoFlex Home Setup: [http://www.openstora.com/]
  Needed to add GD lib (Custom compiled) [/lib/gd.rar]
  Setup the websites document folder in apache
    - Make sure you tell it to ignore .htaccess files (AllowOverride none)
  Add the .htaccess data into apache (As Openstora uses PHP CGI)


Current Progress:
  Gets IMDB Data (Movies/Series+Episodes)
  Saves Data to an SQLite DB (No DB install required)
  Reads Folder and File Structures of Hard Drives
  Gets File Information (Codex, Bitrate, Resolution, etc)
  Validates File Names (I'm quite OCD about my naming conventions)
    - Series: <Name> - S##E## - <Episode Name>.<ext>
    - Movie: <Name>.<ext>


ToDo:
  Write File Information with a File Hash (Unique ID) to the DB
  Create Whole Front End (Web and Samsung Smart TV Versions)

  Figure Out:
    - A way of doing a Last Reference Point to a File
    - The best way to manage the Admin Side (For renaming files, loading information, etc)
    - If it is possible to use this on a Mede8er
